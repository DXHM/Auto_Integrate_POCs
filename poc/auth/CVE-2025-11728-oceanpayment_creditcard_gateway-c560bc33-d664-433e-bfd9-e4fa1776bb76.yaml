  name: >
    Oceanpayment CreditCard Gateway <= 6.0 - Missing Authentication to Unauthenticated Order Status Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Oceanpayment CreditCard Gateway plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthenticated and unauthorized modification of data due to missing authentication and capability checks on the 'return_payment' and 'notice_payment' functions in all versions up to, and including, 6.0. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update WooCommerce orders to 'failed' status, and update transaction IDs.
