  name: >
    WP-DownloadManager <= 1.68.11 - Authenticated (Admin+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP-DownloadManager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the download-add.php file in all versions up to, and including, 1.68.11. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
