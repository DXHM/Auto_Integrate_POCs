    Contest Gallery – Upload, Vote & Sell with PayPal and Stripe <= 27.0.3 - Unauthenticated CSV Injection
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contest Gallery – Upload, Vote & Sell with PayPal and Stripe plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to CSV Injection in all versions up to, and including, 27.0.3 via gallery submissions. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to embed untrusted input into exported CSV files, which can result in code execution when these files are downloaded and opened on a local system with a vulnerable configuration.
