  name: >
    Morning Coffee < 3.6 - Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Morning Coffee theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting via the PATH_INFO to index.php in versions up to 3.6 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that execute if they can successfully trick a user into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
