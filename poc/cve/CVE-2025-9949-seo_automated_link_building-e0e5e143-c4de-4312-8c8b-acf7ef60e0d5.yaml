info:
  name: >
    Internal Links Manager <= 3.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Internal Links Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the link deletion functionality in the process_bulk_action() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete SEO links via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
