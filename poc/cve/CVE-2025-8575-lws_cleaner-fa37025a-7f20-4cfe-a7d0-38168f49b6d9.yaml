    LWS Cleaner <= 2.4.1.3 - Authenticated (Administrator+) Arbitrary File Deletion via 'lws_cl_delete_file'
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The LWS Cleaner plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the 'lws_cl_delete_file' function in all versions up to, and including, 2.4.1.3. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Administrator-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
