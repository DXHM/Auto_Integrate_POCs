  name: >
    DeBounce Email Validator <= 5.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The DeBounce Email Validator plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 5.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'debounce_email_validator' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to update settings and inject malicious web scripts via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link. The Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability has been patched in 5.7, however, the CSRF remains.
