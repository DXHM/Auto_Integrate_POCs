  name: >
    Maspik <= 2.5.6 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Missing Authorization to Spam Log Export
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Maspik plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Missing Authorization in version 2.5.6 and prior. This is due to missing capability checks on the Maspik_spamlog_download_csv function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level access and above, to export and download the spam log database containing blocked submission attempts, which may include misclassified but legitimate submissions with sensitive data.
