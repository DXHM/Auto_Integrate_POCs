  name: >
    Theme Editor <= 3.0 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Remote Code Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Theme Editor plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 3.0. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the 'theme_editor_theme' page. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to achieve remote code execution via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
