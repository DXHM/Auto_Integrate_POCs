    All in One Time Clock Lite – Tracking Employee Time Has Never Been Easier <= 2.0 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary Clocking In/Out
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The All in One Time Clock Lite – Tracking Employee Time Has Never Been Easier plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 2.0 via the 'aio_time_clock_lite_js' AJAX action due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber access and above, to clock other users in and out.
