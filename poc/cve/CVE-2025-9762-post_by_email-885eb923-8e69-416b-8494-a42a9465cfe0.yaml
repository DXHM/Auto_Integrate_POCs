  name: >
    Post By Email <= 1.0.4b - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Upload via Email Attachments
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Post By Email plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the save_attachments function in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.4b. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
