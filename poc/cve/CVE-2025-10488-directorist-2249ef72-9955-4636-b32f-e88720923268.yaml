    Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listings <= 8.4.8 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Move
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Directorist: AI-Powered Business Directory Plugin with Classified Ads Listings plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file move due to insufficient file path validation in the add_listing_action AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 8.4.8. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to move arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is moved (such as wp-config.php).
