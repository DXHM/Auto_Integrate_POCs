info:
  name: >
    Doccure <= 1.4.8 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Doccure theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to incorrect file type validation in the 'doccure_temp_file_uploader' function in all versions up to, and including, 1.4.8. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with subscriber-level and above permissions, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
