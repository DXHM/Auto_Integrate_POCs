  name: >
    Job Board Manager <= 2.1.61 - Authenticated (Job Poster+) Arbitrary Shortcode Execution
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The The Job Board Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary shortcode execution in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.61. This is due to the software allowing users to execute an action that does not properly validate a value before running do_shortcode. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Job Poster-level access and above, to execute arbitrary shortcodes.
