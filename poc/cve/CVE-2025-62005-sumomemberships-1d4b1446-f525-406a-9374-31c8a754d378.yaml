  description: >
    The SUMO Memberships for WooCommerce plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to 7.8.0 (exclusive).

This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
