info:
  name: >
    AdForest <= 6.0.9 - Authentication Bypass to Admin
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The AdForest theme for WordPress is vulnerable to Authentication Bypass in all versions up to, and including, 6.0.9. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying a user's identity prior to authenticating them. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as other users, including administrators, without access to a password.
