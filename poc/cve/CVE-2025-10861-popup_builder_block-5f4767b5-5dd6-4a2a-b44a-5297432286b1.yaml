    Popup builder with Gamification, Multi-Step Popups, Page-Level Targeting, and WooCommerce Triggers <= 2.1.4 - Unauthenticated Server-Side Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Popup builder with Gamification, Multi-Step Popups, Page-Level Targeting, and WooCommerce Triggers plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.1.4. This is due to insufficient validation on the URLs supplied via the URL parameter. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to make web requests to arbitrary locations originating from the web application and can be used to query and modify information from internal services, as well as conduct network reconnaissance. The vulnerability was partially patched in version 2.1.4.
