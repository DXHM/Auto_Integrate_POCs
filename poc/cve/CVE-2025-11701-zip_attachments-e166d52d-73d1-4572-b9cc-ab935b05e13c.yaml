  name: >
    Zip Attachments <= 1.6 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Private And Password-Protected Posts Attachment Disclosure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Zip Attachments plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check as well as missing post status validation in the za_create_zip_callback function in all versions up to, and including, 1.6. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to download attachments from private and password-protected posts.
