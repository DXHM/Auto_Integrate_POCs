    Contact Form and Calls To Action by vcita <= 4.10.5 - Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Contact Form and Calls To Action by vcita plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 4.10.5. This is due to missing nonce validation in the vcita-callback.php file. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify the plugin's settings and inject malicious JavaScript via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
