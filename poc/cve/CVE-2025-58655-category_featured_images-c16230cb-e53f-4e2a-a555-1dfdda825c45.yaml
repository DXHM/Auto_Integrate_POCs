info:
  name: >
    Category Featured Images <= 1.1.8 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Category Featured Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in versions up to, and including, 1.1.8 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page.
