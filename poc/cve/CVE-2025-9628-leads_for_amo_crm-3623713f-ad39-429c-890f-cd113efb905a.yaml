  name: >
    The integration of the AMO.CRM <= 1.0.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The The integration of the AMO.CRM plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.0.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the settings_page function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify critical API connection settings including the AMO.CRM API URL, login credentials, and API hash key via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
