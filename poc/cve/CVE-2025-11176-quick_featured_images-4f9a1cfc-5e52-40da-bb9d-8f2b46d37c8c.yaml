  name: >
    Quick Featured Images <= 13.7.2 - Insecure Direct Object Reference to Image Manipulation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Quick Featured Images plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Insecure Direct Object Reference in all versions up to, and including, 13.7.2 via the qfi_set_thumbnail and qfi_delete_thumbnail AJAX actions due to missing validation on a user controlled key. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to change or remove featured images of other user's posts.
