    Everest Backup <= 2.3.5 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Everest Backup â€“ WordPress Cloud Backup, Migration, Restore & Cloning Plugin plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data due to a missing capability check on the 'everest_process_status' AJAX action in all versions up to, and including, 2.3.5. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to retrieve back-up file locations that can be subsequently accessed and downloaded. This does require a back-up to be running in order for an attacker to retrieve the back-up location.
