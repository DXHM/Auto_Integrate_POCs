    Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution <= 3.8.3 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Payment Status Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Tutor LMS – eLearning and online course solution plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check while verifying webhook signatures on the "verifyAndCreateOrderData" function  
    in all versions up to, and including, 3.8.3. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to bypass payment verification and mark orders as paid by submitting forged webhook requests with `payment_type` set to 'recurring'.
