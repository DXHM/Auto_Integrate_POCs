  name: >
    WP Photo Album Plus <= 9.0.11.006 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting via wppa_user_upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Photo Album Plus plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.11.006 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the wppa_user_upload function. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in the photo album descriptions that execute in a victim's browser.
