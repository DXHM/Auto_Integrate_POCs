    Add to Feedly <= 1.2.11 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Add to Feedly plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.11. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on a function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to perform an unauthorized action granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
