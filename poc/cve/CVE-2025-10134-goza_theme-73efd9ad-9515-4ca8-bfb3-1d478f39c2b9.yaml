    Goza - Nonprofit Charity WordPress Theme <= 3.2.2 - Missing Authorization to Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The Goza - Nonprofit Charity WordPress Theme theme for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the alone_import_pack_restore_data() function in all versions up to, and including, 3.2.2. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
