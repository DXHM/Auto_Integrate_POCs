    Blog Designer PRO <= 3.4.7 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Local File Inclusion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Blog Designer PRO for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Local File Inclusion in all versions up to, and including, 3.4.7. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to include and execute arbitrary .php files on the server, allowing the execution of any PHP code in those files. This can be used to bypass access controls, obtain sensitive data, or achieve code execution in cases where .php file types can be uploaded and included.
