  name: >
    Spirit Framework <= 1.2.14 - Authentication Bypass to Account Takeover and Privilege Escalation
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The Spirit Framework plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to authentication bypass in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.14. This is due to the custom_actions() function not properly validating a user's identity prior to authenticating them to the site. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to log in as any user, including administrators, granted they have access to the administrator's username.
