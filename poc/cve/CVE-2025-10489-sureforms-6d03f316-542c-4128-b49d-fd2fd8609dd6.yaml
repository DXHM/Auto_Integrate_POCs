    SureForms – Drag and Drop Form Builder for WordPress <= 1.12.0 - Missing Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Form Creation
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The SureForms – Drag and Drop Contact Form Builder – Multi-step Forms, Conversational Forms and more plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized creation of forms due to a missing capability check on the register_post_types() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.12.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to create forms when the user interface specifically prohibits it.
