info:
  name: >
    Sync Posts <= 1.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The Sync Posts plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the 'scwp_sync_posts_func' and 'scwp_download_posts_content_images' functions in all versions up to, and including, 1.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible.
