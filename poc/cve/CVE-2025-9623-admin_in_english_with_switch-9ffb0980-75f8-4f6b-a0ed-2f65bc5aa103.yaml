info:
  name: >
    Admin in English with Switch <= 1.1 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Admin in English with Switch plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 1.1. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the enable_eng function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify administrator language settings via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
