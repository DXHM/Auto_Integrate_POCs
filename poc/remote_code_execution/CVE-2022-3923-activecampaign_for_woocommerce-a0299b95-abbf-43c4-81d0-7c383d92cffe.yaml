  name: >
    ActiveCampaign for WooCommerce <= 1.9.7 - Cross-Site Request Forgery
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The ActiveCampaign plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in versions up to, and including, 1.9.7. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clear_error_logs function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to delete the plugin's error logs, via forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
