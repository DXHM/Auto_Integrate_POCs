  name: >
    WordPress <= 6.8.2 - Authenticated (Author+) Stored Cross-Site Scripting
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    WordPress Core is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting in all versions up to, and including, 6.8.2 due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Author-level access and above, to inject arbitrary web scripts in pages that will execute whenever a user accesses an injected page. Please note that no patch is available as this was prematurely disclosed by a third-party on accident, that third-party co-ordinated with the WordPress core team who decided to keep these vulnerabilities publicly available until patched. They pose low risk to WordPress sites and the WordPress security team is actively working on a fix.
