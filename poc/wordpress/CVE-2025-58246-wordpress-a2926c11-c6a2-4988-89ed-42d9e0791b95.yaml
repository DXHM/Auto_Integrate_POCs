    WordPress <= 6.8.2 - Authenticated (Contributor+) Sensitive Information Exposure
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    WordPress Core is vulnerable to Sensitive Information Exposure in all versions up to, and including, 6.8.2. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Contributor-level access and above, to extract sensitive user or configuration data. Please note that no patch is available as this was prematurely disclosed by a third-party on accident, that third-party co-ordinated with the WordPress core team who decided to keep these vulnerabilities publicly available until patched. They pose low risk to WordPress sites and the WordPress security team is actively working on a fix.
