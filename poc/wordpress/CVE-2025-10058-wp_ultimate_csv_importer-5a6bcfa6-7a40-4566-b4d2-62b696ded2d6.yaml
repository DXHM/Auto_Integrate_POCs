    WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress <= 7.27 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Deletion
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Import – Ultimate CSV XML Importer for WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file deletion due to insufficient file path validation in the upload_function() function in all versions up to, and including, 7.27. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to delete arbitrary files on the server, which can easily lead to remote code execution when the right file is deleted (such as wp-config.php).
