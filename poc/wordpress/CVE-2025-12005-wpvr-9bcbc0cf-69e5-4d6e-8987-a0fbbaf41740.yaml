    WP VR – 360 Panorama and Free Virtual Tour Builder For WordPress <= 8.5.41 - Improper Authorization to Authenticated (Contributor+) Plugin Settings Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP VR – 360 Panorama and Free Virtual Tour Builder For WordPress plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized access of data in all versions up to, and including, 8.5.41. This is due to the plugin not properly verifying that a user is authorized to perform an action. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with contributor level access and above, to modify sensitive plugin options.
