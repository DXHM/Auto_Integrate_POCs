    WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) <= 9.0.48 - Unauthenticated Cache Poisoning
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The WP Go Maps (formerly WP Google Maps) plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cache Poisoning in all versions up to, and including, 9.0.48. This is due to the plugin not serving cached data from server-side responses and instead relying on user-input. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to poison the cache location for location search results.
