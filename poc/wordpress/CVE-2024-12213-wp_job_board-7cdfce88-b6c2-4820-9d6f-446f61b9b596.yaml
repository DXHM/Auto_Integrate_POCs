  name: >
    WP Job Board < 2.3.16 - Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation via process_register
  author: topscoder
  severity: critical
  description: >
    The WP Job Board plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to privilege escalation in all versions up to 2.3.16. This is due to the plugin allowing a user to supply the 'role' field when registering. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to register as an administrator on vulnerable sites. Please note that this may have been patched sooner, however, the oldest available version for us to confirm this is patched in was 2.3.16.
