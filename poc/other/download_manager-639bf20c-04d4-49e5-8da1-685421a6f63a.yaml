    Download Manager <= 2.8.7 - Sensitive Information Disclosure via Directory Listing
  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Download Manager plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Directory Listing in versions up to, and including, 2.8.7. This is due to the 'wpdm_dir_tree()' function being called during the 'init' action. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read all of the files listed in that directory.
