  name: >
    WP Dispatcher <= 1.2.0 - Authenticated (Subscriber+) Arbitrary File Upload
  author: topscoder
  severity: low
  description: >
    The WP Dispatcher plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to arbitrary file uploads due to missing file type validation in the wp_dispatcher_process_upload() function in all versions up to, and including, 1.2.0. This makes it possible for authenticated attackers, with Subscriber-level access and above, to upload arbitrary files on the affected site's server which may make remote code execution possible. The directory does have an .htaccess file which limits the ability to achieve remote code execution.
