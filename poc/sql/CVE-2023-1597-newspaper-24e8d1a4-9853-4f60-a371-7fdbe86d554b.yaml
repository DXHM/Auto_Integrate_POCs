    tagDiv Cloud Library < 2.7 - Missing Authorization to Arbitrary User Metadata Update
  author: topscoder
  severity: high
  description: >
    The tagDiv Cloud Library plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to unauthorized modification of data due to a missing capability check on the tdb_user_form_on_submit() function called via an AJAX action in versions prior to 2.7. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to modify arbitrary user metadata and gain elevated privileges.
