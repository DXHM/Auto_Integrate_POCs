  author: topscoder
  severity: medium
  description: >
    The Maspik â€“ Ultimate Spam Protection plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery in all versions up to, and including, 2.5.6. This is due to missing or incorrect nonce validation on the clear_log function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to clear all spam logs via a forged request granted they can trick a site administrator into performing an action such as clicking on a link.
